The source code is the implementation of a .NET WebAPI application that exposes some RESTful APIs for a single page application (not included)

It uses a PostgreSQL database as the primary datastore. Entity Framework is used as the ORM
It also uses an additional MongoDB database to store audit logs (user activities).
The application authenticates users against a LDAP server and uses JWT as the means for authentication client requests

The application follows CQRS pattern where APIs are divided into commands and queries
Autofac is used for dependency injection

Note: I have to exclude configuration values and unit tests from the source code before sharing because they contains some confidential data
